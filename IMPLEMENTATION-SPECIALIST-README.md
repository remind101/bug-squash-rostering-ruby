## Implementation Specialist CSV troubleshooting

### Scenario

 A district has uploaded a set of CSV files to Remind to use rostering to import their data. However after the import was completed they found that one of their classes and one of their users were not imported. There are some problems with the data in their CSV files that we'll need to locate and fix. This district is using the CSV 1.0 Roster Type, and those specifications are located on our help center.

### Challenge 1

The customer is reporting that not all classes were created. They are unsure which class is missing or why it didn't get created. Find which class wasn't created, and why it wasn't created.

### Challenge 2

The customer successfully uploaded their CSVs after fixing the problems found in challenge 1. But unfortunately what was created is still not correct. The customer is reporting that not all users were created. They are unsure which user is missing or why they weren't created. Find which user wasn't created, and why they weren't created.
