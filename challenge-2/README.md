### Challenge 2 - Missing user

The customer successfully uploaded their CSVs after fixing the problems
found in challenge 1. But unfortunately what was created is still not
correct.

The customer is reporting that not all users were created. They are
unsure which user is missing or why they weren't created.

Find which user wasn't created, and why they weren't created. There is
a script in this folder that will help you track down the issue.
You can run using `ruby import_users.rb`.
