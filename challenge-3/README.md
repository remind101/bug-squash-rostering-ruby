#### Challenge 3 - Missing class

The customer successfully fixed the user imports.
But unfortunately what was created is still not 100% correct.

The customer is reporting that not all classes were created. They are
unsure which class is missing or why it didn't get created.

Find which class wasn't created, and why it wasn't created. There is
a script in this folder that will help you track down the issue.
You can run using `ruby import_classes.rb`.
