Rostering is a feature on Remind that allows schools & districts to import data from their School Information System (SIS) into the Remind platform. This data typically includes information about their students, parents, teachers, classes, and schools. 

Scenario: A district has uploaded a set of CSV files to Remind to use rostering to import their data. However after the import was completed they found that one of their classes and one of their users were not imported. There're some problems with the data in their CSV files that we'll need to locate and fix.

This interview consists of two challenges â€” each one addresses one of items missing from the import and has a different Ruby script that you can run to see if you've fixed the problem.
